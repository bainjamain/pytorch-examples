# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository aims at helping people start practically with deep learning with detailed examples. The implementation of very popular architectures are presented in notebooks with useful comments and links. Some less classical and more novel architectures but yet powerful are also presented.

The framework used is [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). PyTorch is the Torch framework ported to Python.
